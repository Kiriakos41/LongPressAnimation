Long Press Button with Progress & Fade Effect in .NET MAUI
This repository demonstrates how to implement a long press button in a .NET MAUI application, which fills with progress and adds a fade effect once the progress reaches 100%. The progress can be paused, continued, and reset on user interaction.

Features
Long Press: The button starts filling when pressed, showing progress in real-time.
Progress Tracking: The progress is displayed on the button as a visual indicator of the ongoing action.
Fade Effect: Once the progress reaches 100%, the button fades out smoothly to indicate the completion of the action.
Unload on Release: The progress smoothly unloads if the user releases the button before completion, resuming where it left off on the next press.
